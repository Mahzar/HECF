# Stress-Strain Test Framework
This is a framework for running scientific experiment in a mechanical setup and capture data and also perform some technical analysis of results. 

The framework integrated all the following tasks in one software:
- Controlling the capture devices for running the test
- Setup the functional paramters of experimental setup including osciloscops etc.
- Automatic control of the validity of the setup
- Time-wise control of the process
- Capturing data from the device and storing in proper data collection centers.
- Experimen management and record control on database
- Perform technical analysis of the raw captured data
- Visualize different reports and generate multiple plots and numerical visualizations.
